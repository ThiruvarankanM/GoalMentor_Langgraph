## Features

- **Intelligent Goal Planning**: AI-powered 4-week structured implementation plans
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress dashboard with completion rates
- **Professional Guidance**: Contextual assistance with actionable strategies and resources
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Clean, professional Streamlit-based UI
- **Resource Recommendations**: Targeted learning resources and professional tools
- **Milestone Management**: Step-by-step progress tracking with completion validation

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GoalMentor_Langgraph.git
cd GoalMentor_Langgraph
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install streamlit python-dotenv langchain-community langchain-core langchain-openai openai
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Groq API key:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## How It Works

### Goal Definition Phase
1. Enter your professional or personal development goal
2. The system generates a structured 4-week implementation plan
3. Each week focuses on a specific milestone toward your goal

### Progress Tracking Phase
1. Mark milestones as completed when finished
2. Request professional guidance if you encounter obstacles
3. Access additional resources and implementation strategies
4. Skip phases if needed while maintaining overall progress

### Completion & Achievement
1. Visual progress tracking with completion percentages
2. Professional celebration upon goal achievement
3. Option to set new goals and continue development
